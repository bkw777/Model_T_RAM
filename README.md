The DIP row spacing is actually 725 mils not 700. It makes it annoying to solder because the rows don't line up exactly with the rows in a breadboard, but it's not an error.  
Using a set of single row socket headers in the breadboard, or even two stacked, allows the socket headers to spread a little and make it easier to hold the pins and pcb for soldering, and the finished soldered pins aren't pinched inwards too badly.
